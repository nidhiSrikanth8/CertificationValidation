I have built this Blockchain-based Certificate Verification DApp (Decentralized App) because I wanted to create a secure and transparent way to verify and validate certificates issued by educational institutions, organizations, or certification authorities. Using the Ethereum blockchain, I leveraged smart contracts to ensure the integrity and authenticity of certificates.

Project Overview

The main goal of my project was to make the process of certificate generation and validation much easier while guaranteeing their integrity by taking advantage of the immutability of blockchain transactions. Additionally, I included a feature to store a digital PDF copy of the certificate on IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), making it easily accessible and decentralized.

Key Features

Blockchain-Based Validation: Certificates are stored on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and immutability.

Smart Contracts: I used smart contracts to ensure the authenticity of certificates.

IPFS Integration: Digital PDF copies of certificates are stored in a decentralized manner using IPFS.

Streamlined Certificate Process: The certificate generation and validation process has been simplified significantly.

Tech Stack

The tools and technologies I used for this project include:

Ganache-cli: For creating a local blockchain network to test and deploy the application.

Truffle: To develop and deploy smart contracts.

Streamlit: For building the web application that users interact with.

Pinata: As an IPFS client for decentralized certificate storage.

Docker: To containerize the application into separate services, making it easier to deploy and manage.
